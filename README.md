This is a project meant to demonstrate my understanding of html. I was tasked with creating a website with a homepage, and three recipies with identical 
formats.

I have both learned, and demonstrated that I can
-Use git and github.
-Make serviceable commit messages.
-Set up the html boilerplate.
-Construct paragraphs.
-Use headings of different sizes.
-Use relative links.
-Embed images with proper formatting.
-Make ordered and unordered lists.
