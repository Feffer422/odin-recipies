            <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
            <p>A basic yet wholesome chicken soup that will leave everyone feeling satisfied.</p>

            <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 raw chicken</li>
                <li>4 big carrots chopped and halved</li>
                <li>2 zuccini chopped and quartered</li>
                <li>2 onions halved and sliced</li>
                <li>2&1/2 cups of frozen peas</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of garlic</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>tumeric until soup becomes colored</li>


            </ul>

            <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Place chicken in a large - very large pot, making sure to check inside the chicken for giblets; these can be thrown away or used in the soup. Add water until chicken is covered, and put on medium high.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>While the chicken cooks, prep the carrots, onions, and zuccini.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Remove once chicken starts to easily come off the bone; about one and a half to two hours. Make sure to drain cavity to avoid burning yourself.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Add vegetables to the pot, and a bit of salt for the veggies to absorb. You can add the veggies in order of cook time, but if your goal is just soft vegetables, just add them all in at once.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Once chicken has cooled, strip it of the meat. Remove any fatty or otherwise unpleasant things from the meat while doing so. You can keep the bones and other undesirable parts if you want to use them for something else; otherwise, just throw them away.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Roughly chop the meat obtained from the chicken to prevent oversized pieces. You can now add the chicken back in at any time.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Add garlic, along with tumeric until the soup becomes colored.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Once garlic flavor has gotten into the soup, add salt and pepper while tasting until desired flavor.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Once everything previous has been done, now would be a good time to add in the chicken if you haven't. Turn off the heat and add in the frozen peas. They will cook from the residual heat and bring the soup to eating temp faster.</li>
            </ol>
