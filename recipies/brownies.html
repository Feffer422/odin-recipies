            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A delicious fudgy chocolate brownie. It is packed with flavor due to the techniques used. It is even variable enough for some substitutions if you don't have all of the ingridients; or, more power to you, you like one of the substitutions more.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 stick butter/115g</li> 
                <li>225g/8oz chocolate + extra for topping (or cacao nibs)</li> 
                <li>100g or 1c brown sugar</li>
                <li>75g or 1/3c white sugar</li>
                <li>75g or 3/4c cocoa powder</li>
                <li>100g or 3/4c flour</li> 
                <li>3 eggs (cold)</li> 
                <li>5g/1Tbsp espresso/instant coffee</li>
                <li>5g or 1tsp kosher salt</li> 
                <li>60g or 1/4c olive oil</li>
                <li>8g or 1/2Tbsp vanilla</li>
                <li>50g or 1/4c buttermilk</li>


            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat small saucepan. When hot, add butter, stiring constantly 
                    and scraping up solids at the bottom. Take off heat once color is dark 
                    and golden.</li>
                
                <li>While butter is still hot, stir in chocolate and espresso or instant coffee to melt.</li>
                
                <li>In a mixer, whisk the eggs and sugars on medium high until thick 
                    and fluffy. This takes several minutes, but it is important as mixing extra 
                    air into them reduces the density of the brownie without reducing the fudgyness.</li>
                
                <li>Put the mixer on low, and add in oil, vanilla, and buttermilk.</li>

                <li>Once the other ingredients are incorporated, 
                    stream in chocolate butter</li>

                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, and salt.</li>

                <li>With the mixer on low, slowly add cocoa/flour mixture to the 
                    wet ingredients. Use a spatula to scrape bowl and finish mixing flour.</li>
                
                <li>Transfer mixture to a prepared 8x8 dish, and sprinkle with 
                    chopped chocolate or cocoa powder. Cover and refridgerate for 2-24 hours.</li>

                <li>Sprinkle with flaky salt, then bake at 350F/175C for 24-26 minutes, 
                    rotating halfway through. Rest on counter until room temp, 
                    then refridgerate until cool.</li>
